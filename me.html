      <p>I'm interested in software/game development because as I growed up i've always been interested and loved playing games no matter the genere. I also understand coding and I'd say if i put in the effort eneded I can and will be great at it. So I decided to work in this field in order to make things I enjoy while doing something I'm good at.</p>
